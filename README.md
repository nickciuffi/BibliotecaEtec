# BibliotecaEtec

This is my TCC from ETEC.
I created, using C#, an organizing system form my schools library.<br>
During the development process, I had to face a lot of dificulties, that made me learn a lot of lessons:
- Programming is very challenging;
- A good mentor is very important (This was my professor Sergio Montagner);
- OOP is a great model to keep you code organized;
